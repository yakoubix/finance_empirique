@article{Welch2006,
abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers & results.},

abstract = {Abstract The financial crisis of 2007–8 was experienced and reflected upon as a crisis of knowledge, the perennial question being why nobody accurately understood the risks that were being taken within the financial sector. In the wake of the crisis, there have been demands that rational economic knowledge be extended further and more vigorously, to prevent such ignorance being possible in future. At the same time, there have been demands for a new, softer rationalism, which factors in the possibility of errors and systemic complexities. What neither approach recognizes is that ignorance is not simply the absence of rational economic knowledge, but is a productive force in itself, something that is actively nurtured and exploited, both by neo-liberal theorists such as Hayek and by expert actors who have been implicated in the financial crisis. We explore how ignorance has been alternately an albatross, a commodity and an institutional alibi to financial actors and the scholars who study them.},

abstract = {We show that several advanced equity option models incorporating stochastic volatility can be calibrated very nicely to a realistic option surface. More speciﬁcally, we focus on the Heston Stochastic Volatility model (with and without jumps in the stock price process), the Barndorﬀ- Nielsen-Shephard model and L´vy models with stochastic time. All these e models are capable of accurately describing the marginal distribution of stock prices or indices and hence lead to almost identical European vanilla option prices. As such, we can hardly discriminate between the diﬀerent processes on the basis of their smile-conform pricing characteristics. We therefore are tempted applying them to a range of exotics. However, due to the diﬀerent structure in path-behaviour between these models, the resulting exotics prices can vary signiﬁcantly. We subsequently introduce moment derivatives. These are derivatives that depend on the realized moments of (daily) logreturns. An already traded example of these deriv- atives is the Variance Swap. We ﬁnally show how to hedge these options and calculate their prices by Monte-Carlo simulation. A comparison of these moment derivatives premiums demonstrates an even bigger discrep- ancy between the aforementioned models. It motivates a further study on how to model the ﬁne stochastic behaviour of assets over time.},

show how American style and exotic energy derivatives can be priced
using trinomial trees, which are constructed to be consistent with
the forward curve and volatility structure. We demonstrate the application
of the trinomial tree to the pricing of a European and American Asian
option. The analysis in this paper extends the results in Schwartz

abstract = {Practical large-scale mathematical programming involves more than just the application of an algorithm to minimize or maximize an objective function. Before any optimizing routine can be invoked, considerable e{\textregistered}ort must be expended to formulate the underlying model and to generate the requisite computational data structures. AMPL is a new language designed to make these steps easier and less error-prone. AMPL closely resembles the symbolic algebraic notation that many modelers use to describe mathematical programs, yet it is regular and formal enough to be processed by a computer system; it is particularly notable for the generality of its syntax and for the variety of its indexing operations. We have implemented a translator that takes as input a linear AMPL model and associated data, and produces output suitable for standard linear programming optimizers. Both the language and the translator admit straightforward extensions to more general mathematical programs that incorporate nonlinear expressions or discrete variables.},

The I-T approaches can replace the usual t tests and ANOVA tables that are so inferentially limited, but still commonly used. The I-T methods are easy to compute and understand and provide formal measures of the strength of evidence for both the null and alternative hypotheses, given the data. We give an example to highlight the importance of deriving alternative hypotheses and representing these as probability models. Fifteen technical issues are addressed to clarify various points that have appeared incorrectly in the recent literature. We offer several remarks regarding the future of empirical science and data analysis under an I-T framework.},

abstract = {This paper addresses several related epistemological difficulties with the neoclassical micro‐foundations of standard economics, and explores what these difficulties imply about the recent dominance of these micro‐foundations in both economic research and applied policy and finance settings. Building on the crucial distinction made by Knight and Keynes between calculable risk and uncertainty, the paper makes a further distinction between two types of uncertainty – epistemological and ontological. It argues that standard economics underestimates how problematic the interface between theory and reality is for both economic agents and social scientists, and overlooks the impossibility of knowing the future yet to be created by innovation and the freedom to choose. The paper outlines alternative micro‐foundations that capture how agents use imagination and narratives alongside market coordination to cope with uncertainty and construct the future. It also explains several research and policy implications of taking uncertainty seriously – the limits of prediction, the incoherence of many bolt‐on amendments to neo‐classical theory, the dangers of analytical monocultures, and the importance of discourse analysis and pluralism in modelling. Recognition that neo‐classical models are inappropriate for dealing with problems characterised by widespread innovation and uncertainty should augment rather than reduce the undoubted value of these same models in many other areas of analysis.},

@article{Hahn2008534,
abstract = {In this paper the recombining binomial lattice approach for modeling
real options and valuing managerial flexibility is generalized to
address a common issue in many practical applications, underlying
stochastic processes that are mean-reverting. Binomial lattices were
first introduced to approximate stochastic processes for valuation
of financial options, and they provide a convenient framework for
numerical analysis. Unfortunately, the standard approach to constructing
binomial lattices can result in invalid probabilities of up and down
moves in the lattice when a mean-reverting stochastic process is
to be approximated. There have been several alternative methods introduced
for modeling mean-reverting processes, including simulation-based
approaches and trinomial trees, however they unfortunately complicate
the numerical analysis of valuation problems. The approach developed
in this paper utilizes a more general binomial approximation methodology
from the existing literature to model simple homoskedastic mean-reverting
stochastic processes as recombining lattices. This approach is then
extended to model dual correlated one-factor mean-reverting processes.
These models facilitate the evaluation of options with early-exercise
characteristics, as well as multiple concurrent options. The models
we develop in this paper are tested by implementing the lattice in
binomial decision tree format and applying to a real application
by solving for the value of an oil and gas switching option which
requires a binomial model of two correlated one-factor commodity
price models. For cases where the number of discrete time periods
becomes too large to be solved using common decision tree software,
we describe how recursive dynamic programming algorithms can be developed
to generate solutions.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a short introduction about Portfolio Insurance. A general framework is proposed that encompasses the common investment strategies: constant-mix, buy-and-hold and constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI). Option based portfolio insurance (OBPI) strategies are also discussed. To get the value of an investment guaranteed is quite appealing. This type of strategy originated in the 70's following Leland's idea and started to develop in the financial industry in the 80's. Three questions arise: what is portfolio insurance, why does it exist and what is the cost of this strategy. This paper defines the portfolio insurance strategy, provides examples and introduces some history about this strategy. Then, we ask why do people buy portfolio insurance. The paper provides some answers by studying the possible utility functions corresponding to these strategies. The impact of the path dependency of the strategy is also presented. The cost of portfolio insurance is also studied. Finally, we provide some insights about specific issues.},

abstract = {When assessing map accuracy, confusion matrices are fre- quently statistically compared using kappa. While kappa al- lows individual matrix categories to be analyzed with respect to either omission or commission error rates, kappa is not used to compare individual matrix categories with respect to both rates concurrently. When this concurrent comparison is desired, the ma trices are typically normalized and then scru- tinized on a cell-by-cell basis by inspection. While no para- metric test of significance exists for such a cell-by-cell exami- nation, sampling distributions for these main diagonal entries can be estimated by repeated subsampling of the original sample data (i.e., bootstrapping), allowing inferences to be made about the population. In this research, the procedure for estimating the sampling distribution of normalized cell values is described. Three methods for determining the stan- dard error of normalized cell value sampling distributions are also outlined. Using these sampling distributions and their attendant standard error, the statistical comparison of cell values from two normalized confusion matrices is illus- trated. One illustrated method requires a mild parametric assumption, whereas the other is completely nonparametric. Nevertheless, the two distinct bootstrap methods produce nearly identical results.

Une bizarrerie que l'auteur du chapitre consacr{\'{e}} {\`{a}} ce pays explique (tout en se gardant de verser dans une interpr{\'{e}}tation culturaliste) par la pr{\'{e}}gnance du tao{\"{i}}sme et de son bin{\^{o}}me yin et yang dans l'appr{\'{e}}ciation des catastrophes et autres cataclysmes.\n\nTout en soulignant la n{\'{e}}cessit{\'{e}} d'une approche pluridisciplinaire, l'ouvrage entend cependant aussi montrer l'utilit{\'{e}} de l'approche g{\'{e}}ographique. Ainsi qu'on le devine au fil des chapitres, celle-ci ne se limite pas {\`{a}} la compr{\'{e}}hension des seuls risques naturels, environnementaux ou climatiques. Parce qu'ils ont une expression spatiale, les risques quels qu'ils soient int{\'{e}}ressent le g{\'{e}}ographe, et c'est pr{\'{e}}cis{\'{e}}ment en l'analysant par le prisme de l'espace et de la repr{\'{e}}sentation cartographique que celui-ci se singularise. Un autre de ses apports r{\'{e}}side aussi dans ce soin mis {\`{a}} rendre compte des sp{\'{e}}cificit{\'{e}}s des risques selon le niveau de d{\'{e}}veloppement des pays (voir les parties ii et iii consacr{\'{e}}es respectivement aux risques dans les pays en d{\'{e}}veloppement et dans les pays riches). Enfin, ce sont les g{\'{e}}ographes qui s'attachent {\`{a}} articuler la question des risques {\`{a}} la probl{\'{e}}matique du d{\'{e}}veloppement dit durable. Tous les g{\'{e}}ographes ? En fait, ceux, comme on l'aura compris, qui entreprennent de mieux articuler les g{\'{e}}ographies physiques, sociales et humaines.},

In contrast to the prevalent view that involvement in organizational practices almost automatically makes models performative, this paper argues that institutional design might obstruct potential model performativity. This crucial issue determines whether models are strongly or only ‘generically' or ‘effectively' performative. The empirical study of the usage of the discounted cash flow (DCF) model presented in this paper offers an example of an application practice that significantly limits the model's performative power.

abstract = {Cross-platform development is a kind of holy grail, and Trolltech's Qt toolkit may well be the most promising solution yet to this development challenge. Qt is widely used for the development of GUI applications as well as console tools and servers, and it's especially appealing to programmers who need to write cross-platform applications to run on Linux/Unix, Mac, and Windows machines without having to rewrite for each platform. The Book of Qt 4 offers an in-depth explanation of Qt 4 that goes beyond the common focus on C++ programming. Author Daniel Molkentin uses practical examples to explain features like the signal/slot concept and the event system, as he guides you through developing applications with and without Qt's graphical GUI builder, Qt Designer. And as a core KDE developer, Molkentin's head is full of real-world problems and solutions that he peppers liberally throughout The Book of Qt 4, making it a resource that you'll consult time and again. You'll find coverage of: Tools for creating dialogs GUI design with the Qt Designer Widget layout and dialog construction Data visualization using Qt's model/view concept The QtSql module and the graphics library Arthur File handling, XML, processes, and network connections Databases and threading Event handling and using drag and drop Internationalization and debugging As well as lots of useful hints on how to use Qt's datatypes, containers, and algorithms and how to develop user-friendly applications. Whether you're already a Qt developer or you're just considering Qt for cross-platform development, you'll find The Book of Qt 4 to be indispensable.},

abstract = {The assessment of models of financial market behavior requires evaluation tools. When complexity hinders a direct estimation approach, e.g., for agent basedmicrosimulationmodels or complex multifractal models, simulation based estimators might provide an alternative. In order to apply such techniques, an objective function is required, which should be based on robust statistics of the time series under consideration. Based on the identification of robust statistics of foreign exchange rate time series in previous research, an objective function is derived. This function takes into account stylized facts about the unconditional distribution of exchange rate returns and properties of the conditional distribution, in particular, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and long memory. A bootstrap procedure is used to obtain an estimate of the variance-covariancematrix of the different moments included in the objective function, which is used as a base for the weighting matrix. Finally, the properties of the objective function are analyzed for two different agent based models of the foreign exchange market, a simple GARCH-model and a stochastic volatility model using the DM/US- exchange rate as a benchmark. It is also discussed how the results might be used for inference purposes.},

We use the concepts of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion to formalize the idea of an investor's "familiarity" toward assets. The model shows that for any given level of expected returns, the optimal portfolio depends on two quantities: relative ambiguity across assets and the standard deviation of the expected return estimate for each asset. If both quantities are low, then the optimal portfolio consists of a mix of familiar and unfamiliar assets; moreover, an increase in correlation between assets causes an investor to increase concentration in familiar assets (flight to familiarity). Alternatively, if both quantities are high, then the optimal portfolio contains only the familiar asset(s), as Keynes would have advocated. In the extreme case in which both quantities are very high, no risky asset is held (nonparticipation). {\textcopyright} 2012 INFORMS.},

equation, a partial

differential equation that governs the value of financial derivatives,

various derivations of the Black-Scholes equation are illustrated.
Throughout these derivations,

core concepts in financial mathematics, such as Ito's lemma, the replicating
portfolio, the CAPM,

arbitrage pricing, risk-neutral pricing, and put-call parity, are
presented. One of the great surprises

is the fact that the expected return of the underlying asset does
not appear in the Black-Scholes

equation, which is discussed in this paper. Finally, we introduce
the theoretical valuation formula

for a European call option case. This survey paper also provides examples
of how the important

abstract = {Model risk as part of the operational risk is a serious problem for
financial institutions. As the pricing of derivatives as well as
the computation of the market or credit risk of an institution depend
on statistical models the application of a wrong model can lead to
a serious over- or underestimation of the institution's risk. Because
the underlying data generating process is unknown in practice evaluating
the model risk is a challenge. So far, definitions of model risk
are either application-oriented including risk induced by the statistician
rather than by the statistical model or research-oriented and too
abstract to be used in practice. Especially, they are not data-driven.
We introduce a data driven notion of model risk which includes the
features of the research-oriented approach by extending it by a statistical
model building procedure and therefore compromises between the two
definitions at hand. We furthermore suggest the application of robust
estimates to reduce the model risk and advocate the application of
stress tests with respect to the valuation of the portfolio.},

abstract = {In a two-level nested simulation, an outer level of simulation samples scenarios, while the inner level uses simulation to estimate a conditional expectation given the scenario. Applications include financial risk management, assessing the effects of simulation input uncertainty, and computing the expected value of gathering more information in decision theory. We show that an ANOVA-like estimator of the variance of the conditional expectation is unbiased under mild conditions, and we discuss the optimal number of inner-level samples to minimize this estimator's variance given a fixed computational budget. We show that as the computational budget increases, the optimal number of inner-level samples remains bounded. This finding contrasts with previous work on two-level simulation problems in which the inner- and outer-level sample sizes must both grow without bound for the estimation error to approach zero. The finding implies that the variance of a conditional expectation can be estimated to arbitrarily high precision by a simulation experiment with a fixed inner-level computational effort per scenario, which we call a one-and-a-half-level simulation. Because the optimal number of inner-level samples is often quite small, a one-and-a-half-level simulation can avoid the heavy computational burden typically associated with two-level simulation.},

abstract = {This article examines the covariance matrices that are often used for internal value at risk models. We first show how the large covariance matrices necessary for global risk management systems can be generated using orthogonalization procedures in conjunction with univariate volatility forecasting methods. We then examine the performance of three common volatility forecasting methods: the equally weighted average of squared returns; the exponentially weighted average; and generalized autortegressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH). Standard statistical evaluation criteria using equity and foreign exchange data with 1996 as the test period give mixed results, although they generally favor the exponentially weighted moving average methodology for all but very short-term holding periods. But these criteria assess the ability to model the center of returns distributions, while value at risk models require accuracy in the tails. Operational evaluation takes the form of backtesting volatility forecasts following the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) guidelines. For almost all major equity markets and U.S. dollar exchange rates, both the equally weighted average and the GARCH models produce results falling within the acceptable "green zone." But on most of the test data, and particularly for foreign exchange, using predictions from exponentially weighted moving average models leads to an unacceptably high number of outliers. Thus value at risk measures calculated using this method would be understated.},

abstract = {This paper is an expository survey of the mathematical aspects of statistical inference as it applies to finite Markov chains, the problem being to draw inferences about the transition probabilities from one long, unbroken observation {x1,x2,⋯,xn} on the chain. The topics covered include Whittle's formula, chi-square and maximum-likelihood methods, estimation of parameters, and multiple Markov chains. At the end of the paper it is briefly indicated how these methods can be applied to a process with an arbitrary state space or a continuous time parameter. Section 2 contains a simple proof of Whittle's formula; Section 3 provides an elementary and self-contained development of the limit theory required for the application of chi-square methods to finite chains. In the remainder of the paper, the results are accompanied by references to the literature, rather than by complete proofs. As is usual in a review paper, the emphasis reflects the author's interests. Other general accounts of statistical inference on Markov processes will be found in Grenander [53], Bartlett [9] and [10], Fortet [35], and in my monograph [18]. I would like to thank Paul Meier for a number of very helpful discussions on the topics treated in this paper, particularly those of Section 3.},

abstract = {In the present work we introduce a stochastic cellular automata model in order to simulate the dynamics of the stock market. A direct percolation method is used to create a hierarchy of clusters of active traders on a two dimensional grid. Active traders are characterised by the decision to buy, (+1), or sell, (-1), a stock at a certain discrete time step. The remaining cells are inactive,(0). The trading dynamics is then determined by the stochastic interaction between traders belonging to the same cluster. Most of the stylized aspects of the financial market time series are reproduced by the model.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a simulated method of moments estimator that is implemented by choosing the vector valued moment function to be the expectation under the structural model of the score function of an auxiliary model, where the parameters of the auxiliary model are eliminated by replacing them with their quasi-maximum likelihood estimates. This leaves a moment vector depending only on the parameters of the structural model. Structural parameter estimates are those parameter values that put the moment vector as closely to zero as possible in a suitable generalized method of moments metric. This methodology can also be interpreted as a practical computational strategy for implementing indirect inference. One argues that considerations from statistical science dictate that the auxiliary model should approximate the true data-generating process as closely as possible and show that using the seminonparametric model is one means to this end. When the view of close approximation is accepted in implementation, the methodology described here is usually referred to as Efficient Method of Moments in the literature because the estimator is asymptotically as efficient as maximum likelihood under correct specification and the detection of model error is assured under incorrect specification. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

They cannot be applied literally, but do provide us with figurative knowledge-an epistemologically meaningful form that might legitimately be called a "useful framework," as the CAPM is commonly referred to in textbooks. This paper describes the scientific value of metaphors and discusses why the OPM ought to be seen as one and what this might mean. As a result of finance research and the development of what has been called "modern finance theory," of which the CAPM and OPM are important parts, we can certainly understand financial relationships much better, but that "understanding" is quite different from what our research methods imply that it is. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {We present a framework for calibrating a pricing model to a prescribed set of option prices quoted in the market. Our algorithm yields an arbitrage-free diffusion process that minimizes the relative entropy distance to a prior diffusion. We solve a constrained (minimax) optimal control problem using a finite-difference scheme for a Bellman parabolic equation combined with a gradient-based optimization routine. The number of unknowns in the optimization step is equal to the number of option prices that need to be matched, and is independent of the mesh-size used for the scheme. This results in an efficient, non- parametric calibration method that can match an arbitrary number of option prices to any desired degree of accuracy. The algorithm can be used to interpolate, both in strike and expiration date, between implied volatilities of traded options and to price exotics. The stability and qualitative properties of the computed volatility surface are discussed, including the effect of the Bayesian prior on the shape of the surface and on the implied volatility smile/skew. The method is illustrated by calibrating to market prices of Dollar-Deutschemark over-the-counter options and computing interpolated implied-volatility curves.},

It consists of 18 chapters.

The authors suggest a few possibilities on how to use their book." (Kazimierz Musial, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1125 (2), 2008) "The title of the book consists of the names of its two basic parts. The booka (TM)s third part is comprised of some special topics from probability theory. a The authors suggest using the book intwo-semester graduate programs in statistics or a one-semester seminar on special topics. The material of the book is standard a is clear, comprehensive and a $\sim$without being intimidatinga (TM)." (Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006},

These probabilities are then used to infer a unique fully specified recombining binomial tree that is consistent with these probabilities (and, hence, consistent with all the observed option prices). A simple backwards recursive procedure solves for the entire tree. From the standpoint of the standard binomial option pricing model, which implies a limiting risk-neutral lognormal distribution for the underlying asset, the approach here provides the natural (and probably the simplest) way to generalize to arbitrary ending risk-neutral probability distributions.},

abstract = {The ongoing economic crisis has profoundly changed the industry of the asset management, by putting risk management at the heart of most investment processes. This new risk-based investment style does not rely on returns forecasts and is therefore assumed to be more robust. In 2011, it has particularly encountered a great success with the achievement of minimum variance, ERC and risk parity strategies in portfolios of several large institutional investors. These portfolio constructions are special cases of a more general class of allocation models, known as the risk budgeting approach. In a risk budgeting portfolio, the risk contribution from each components is equal to the budget of risk defined by the portfolio manager. Unfortunately, even if risk budgeting techniques are widely used by market practitioners, they are few results about the behavior of such portfolios in the academic literature. In this paper, we derive the theoretical properties of the risk budgeting portfolio and show that its volatility is located between those of minimum variance and weight budgeting portfolios. We also discuss the existence, uniqueness and optimality of such a portfolio. In a second part of the paper, we propose several applications of risk budgeting techniques for risk-based allocation, like risk parity funds and strategic asset allocation, and equity and bond alternative indexations.},

a simple method is developed to test several option pricing formulas
simultaneously, and the statistical significance and consistency
across subsamples of the most important reported results are unusually
high. The three key results are: (1) short-maturity out-of-the-money
calls are priced significantly higher relative to other calls than
the Black-Scholes model would predict, (2) striking price biases
relative to the Black-Scholes model are also statistically significant

explain this reversal.},

abstract = {We propose a method for calibrating a volatility surface that matches option prices using an entropy-inspired framework. Starting with a stochastic volatility model for asset prices, we cast the estimation problem as a variational one and we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman ({HJB)} equation for the volatility surface. We study the asymptotics of the {HJB} equation assuming that the stochastic volatility model exhibits fast mean-reversion. From the asymptotic solution of the {HJB} equation we get an estimate of the stochastic volatility surface. We also incorporate uncertainty in quoted derivative prices through a penalty term, i.e. by softening the constraints in the {HJB} equation. We present numerical solutions of our estimation scheme. We ﬁnd that, depending on the softness of the constraints, certain parameters of the volatility surface related to the implied volatility smile can be calibrated so that they are stable over time. These parameters are essentially the ones found in previous fast mean-reversion asymptotics papers by Fouque, Papanicolaou and Sircar. We ﬁnd that our procedure provides a natural way of interpolating between the prior parameters and the parameters of Fouque, Papanicolaou and Sircar.},

The variables projected by this model include interest rates, inflation, equity returns, dividend yields, real estate returns, and unemployment rates. This paper contains a description of the key issues involved in modeling these series, a review of the primary literature in this area, an explanation of parameter selection issues, and an illustration of the model's output.

abstract = {The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities.},

@unpublished{Kanzler1999,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the study of some fundamental aspects of the BDS test. Brock, Dechert, Scheinkman & LeBaron (Econometric Reviews, 1996) propose this non-parametric tool as a test of the null hypothesis of an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) time series, with power against virtually all linear and non-linear, stochastic and deterministic ("chaotic") alternatives. Unfortunately, it is extremely processing-intensive and requires an efficient computer algorithm to be viably run even on relatively small data sets. An algorithm is presented which is very fast, rather simple and easily implemented in common programming environments; a version for MATLAB is part of the paper. The algorithm overcomes a number of deficiencies of the two most widely used BDS packages by Dechert and LeBaron. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted which show that the properties of the BDS statistic are sensitive to the choice of embedding dimension and dimensional distance, and to sample size. Unless the choice parameters are set in accordance with the recommendations emerging from the simulations, a statistical test for "iidness" is bound to be badly sized on small samples and thus yield misleading conclusions. Tables of the small-sample distribution are offered for correctly sized testing. The recommendations, tabulated quantile values and computer algorithms put forward will hopefully help render the BDS test part of the standard econometric toolbox.},

abstract = {Consider an option on a stock whose volatility is unknown and stochastic. An agent assumes this volatility to be a specific function of time and the stock price, knowing that this assumption may result in a misspecification of the volatility. However, if the misspecified volatility dominates the true volatility, then the misspecified price of the option dominates its true price. Moreover, the option hedging strategy computed under the assumption of the misspecified volatility provides an almost sure one-sided hedge for the option under the true volatility. Analogous results hold if the true volatility dominates the misspecified volatility. These comparisons can fail, however, if the misspecified volatility is not assumed to be a function of time and the stock price. The positive results, which apply to both European and American options, are used to obtain a bound and hedge for Asian options.},

equation, a partial

differential equation that governs the value of financial derivatives,

various derivations of the Black-Scholes equation are illustrated.
Throughout these derivations,

core concepts in financial mathematics, such as Ito's lemma, the replicating
portfolio, the CAPM,

arbitrage pricing, risk-neutral pricing, and put-call parity, are
presented. One of the great surprises

is the fact that the expected return of the underlying asset does
not appear in the Black-Scholes

equation, which is discussed in this paper. Finally, we introduce
the theoretical valuation formula

for a European call option case. This survey paper also provides examples
of how the important

tools of financial mathematics are actually used.},

After discussing Carnap–Hintikka inductive logic,hypotheses schemes are defined and illustrated with two partitions.

Following theseexamples I argue that choosing a partition comes down to making inductiveassumptions on patterns in the data, and that by choosing appropriately anyinductive assumption can be made. Further considerations on partitions makeclear that they do not suggest any solution to the problem of induction.Hypotheses schemes provide the tools for making inductive assumptions, but theyalso reveal the need for such assumptions.},

abstract = {To decide whether a given sequence is “truely” random, or independent and identically distributed, we need to resort to nonparametric tests for randomness. Six tests: the ordinary run test, the sign test, the runs up and down test, the Mann-Kendall test, the Bartels' rank test and the test based on entropy estimators are introduced in this report and their weaknesses are analyzed. Combining the decisions made by each test, we can further improve the confidence on the randomness of a given sequence. As an example, the tests are applied to test the randomness of DCT coefficient channels of images. Surprisingly, the results show that almost half of DCT AC coefficient channels are decided “i.i.d” for the image Lena, while only three are decided “i.i.d” for the image Baboon.},

abstract = {Modern products ranging from simple components to complex systems should be designed to be optimal and reliable. The challenge of modern engineering is to ensure that manufacturing costs are reduced and design cycle times are minimized while achieving requirements for performance and reliability. If the market for the product is competitive, improved quality and reliability can generate very strong competitive advantages. Simulation based design plays an important role in designing almost any kind of automotive, aerospace, and consumer products under these competitive conditions. Single discipline simulations used for analysis are being coupled together to create complex coupled simulation tools. This investigation focuses on the development of efficient and robust methodologies for reliability based design optimization in a simulation based design environment. Original contributions of this research are the development of a novel efficient and robust unilevel methodology for reliability based design optimization, the development of an innovative decoupled reliability based design optimization methodology, the application of homotopy techniques in unilevel reliability based design optimization methodology, and the development of a new framework for reliability based design optimization under epistemic uncertainty. The unilevel methodology for reliability based design optimization is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the traditional nested formulation. Numerical test problems show that the unilevel methodology can reduce computational cost by at least 50% as compared to the nested approach. The decoupled reliability based design optimization methodology is an approximate technique to obtain consistent reliable designs at lesser computational expense. Test problems show that the methodology is computationally efficient compared to the nested approach. A framework for performing reliability based design optimization under epistemic uncertainty is also developed. A trust region managed sequential approximate optimization methodology is employed for this purpose. Results from numerical test studies indicate that the methodology can be used for performing design optimization under severe uncertainty.},

abstract = {We propose a method for calibrating a volatility surface that matches option prices using an entropy-inspired framework. Starting with a stochastic volatility model for asset prices, we cast the estimation problem as a variational one and we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman ({HJB)} equation for the volatility surface. We study the asymptotics of the {HJB} equation assuming that the stochastic volatility model exhibits fast mean-reversion. From the asymptotic solution of the {HJB} equation we get an estimate of the stochastic volatility surface. We also incorporate uncertainty in quoted derivative prices through a penalty term, i.e. by softening the constraints in the {HJB} equation. We present numerical solutions of our estimation scheme. We ﬁnd that, depending on the softness of the constraints, certain parameters of the volatility surface related to the implied volatility smile can be calibrated so that they are stable over time. These parameters are essentially the ones found in previous fast mean-reversion asymptotics papers by Fouque, Papanicolaou and Sircar. We ﬁnd that our procedure provides a natural way of interpolating between the prior parameters and the parameters of Fouque, Papanicolaou and Sircar.},

abstract = {Significantly driven by JP Morgan's RiskMetrics system with EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) forecasting technique, value-at-risk (VaR) has turned to be a popular measure of the degree of various risks in financial risk management. In this paper we propose a new approach termed skewed-EWMA to forecast the changing volatility and formulate an adaptively efficient procedure to estimate the VaR. Differently from the JP Morgan's standard-EWMA, which is derived from a Gaussian distribution, and the Guermat and Harris (2001)'s robust-EWMA, from a Laplace distribution, we motivate and derive our skewed-EWMA procedure from an asymmetric Laplace distribution, where both skewness and heavy tails in return distribution and the time-varying nature of them in practice are taken into account. An EWMA-based procedure that adaptively adjusts the shape parameter controlling the skewness and kurtosis in the distribution is suggested. Backtesting results show that our proposed skewed-EWMA method offers a viable improvement in forecasting VaR.},

abstract = {This article develops a methodology for quantifying model risk in quantile risk estimates. The application of quantile estimates to risk assessment has become common practice in many disciplines, including hydrology, climate change, statistical process control, insurance and actuarial science, and the uncertainty surrounding these estimates has long been recognized. Our work is particularly important in finance, where quantile estimates (called Value-at-Risk) have been the cornerstone of banking risk management since the mid 1980s. A recent amendment to the Basel II Accord recommends additional market risk capital to cover all sources of "model risk" in the estimation of these quantiles. We provide a novel and elegant framework whereby quantile estimates are adjusted for model risk, relative to a benchmark which represents the state of knowledge of the authority that is responsible for model risk. A simulation experiment in which the degree of model risk is controlled illustrates how to quantify Value-at-Risk model risk and compute the required regulatory capital add-on for banks. An empirical example based on real data shows how the methodology can be put into practice, using only two time series (daily Value-at-Risk and daily profit and loss) from a large bank. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications to nonfinancial risks.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {The estimation of prepayment rates for pools of mortgages is a critical component in determining the value of mortgage-backed securities--MBS for short--and derivative products. This paper discusses the development of prepayment models for pools of fixed-rate mortgages. The models are complete: calibrated functional forms are given for all of the factors that determine prepayment rates. Hence, the models can be used as benchmarks against the simple models of the Public Securities Association, the Federal Housing Administration experience, or the variety of projected prepayment rates generated by proprietary industry models.  The key factors that determine prepayment rates are: (1) refinancing incentive, (2) seasonal variations, (3) seasoning of the mortgage pool, and (4) burnout effect. Each factor is modeled separately and Is calibrated using historical data. A multiplicative relationship determines the prepayment rate of the mortgage pool. A novel feature of our model is the use of basis functions that capture the complex interactions between the control variables, i.e., interest rate differentials and time, and the response parameter, i.e., prepayment rates.

annote = {Two interpretations of "crisis"
- tail event
- mechanical result of complex dynamic system

The nature of information

- Information is model-dependent

Statistical view (EMH): every piece of news that is reflected into prices will be characterized as relevant information (and, conversely, all what does not impact prices will be deemed non-information).

For Lakatos (1970), two research programmes differ primarily through their negative heuristic, i.e. the hard core of assumptions that cannot be rejected by methodological choice.

Prediction of crisis
- Quantitative (time and magnitude)
- Qualitative (general pattern of events)

How:


Prediction within a statistical view of crises is not
about foreseeing particular future events but consists essentially in assigning probabilities to
events or scenarios.

The prediction is primarily intended to capture structural changes
deemed unsustainable on the basis of either a pure theoretical knowledge or past experience.
Rather than market prices it will be primarily based on macro or microeconomic time-series,
especially on the balance sheet of financial institutions, whose structural changes are thought
to affect the conditional distribution of the outcome variables.},

@misc{Kerkhof2002,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a general framework for quantiﬁcation of model risk. This framework allows one to allocate regulatory capital to positions in a given market depending on the extent to which this market can be reliably modeled. Our approach is based on computing worst-case risk measures over sets of models that are in some appropriate sense close to a nominal model. The method is general in the sense that it can be applied with any of the usual risk measures such as Value-at-Risk and Tail Conditional Expectation. Inasfar as risk measures can also be used as pricing tools or as determinants of margin requirements, the paper provides a quantiﬁcation of model risk in these settings as well. We present applications both to stock portfolios and to derivative products: we ﬁnd that, for usual speciﬁcations, misspeciﬁcation risk is much more important than estimation risk.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss how to compare various (possibly misspecified) density forecast models using the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion (KLIC) of a candidate density forecast model with respect to thetruedensity. The KLIC-differential between a pair of competing models is the (predictive) log-likelihood ratio (LR) between the two models. Even though the true density is unknown, using the LR statistic amounts to comparing models with the KLIC as a loss function and thus enables us to assess which density forecast model can approximate the true density more closely. We also discuss how this KLIC is related to the KLIC based on the probability integral transform (PIT) in the framework of Diebold et al. (1998). While they are asymptotically equivalent, the PIT-based KLIC is best suited for evaluating the adequacy of each density forecast model and the original KLIC is best suited for comparing competing models. In an empirical study with the S&P500 and NASDAQ daily return series, we find strong evidence for rejecting the Normal-GARCH benchmark model, in favor of the models that can capture skewness in the conditional distribution and asymmetry and long-memory in the conditional variance.},

abstract = {Financial models are a mainstay in business law. They are used to
assess investment

value, quantify alleged damages, explain relationships, provide theoretical
support, or

debunk an opposing expert's evidence. More recently, certain events
seem to be push-

ing financial model-related issues into the spotlight more so than
in the past.

Shareholders are not happy campers. Their portfolios have plummeted
in value and possible rea-

sons such as poor managerial oversight, anemic market conditions,
and uncertainty about nation-

al security are unlikely to disappear quickly. Not surprisingly, lawyers
are busy helping clients

seek recompense. One approach is to compare stated asset values with
their true price. With

Enron, “SEC investigators are trying to determine how and when the
assets whose stated value is

expected to be cut were placed on the balance sheet. Regulators are
looking into whether their

value was artificially inflated and what executives were involved
in those decisions” Some mutual funds 

are being investigated, too. “Van Wagoner's Emerging Growth fund and
MeVC, which

are also both the subject of shareholder litigation, seem to have
attracted SEC interest because of

the recent dramatic mark-downs of their venture capital portfolios.”
The list goes on.

We estimate the model using comprehensive data on the pool-level termination rates for Freddie Mac Participation Certificates issued between 1991 and 2002. The model exhibits a statistically and economically significant improvement over the nested one-factor (interest-rate only) model in its ability to match historical prepayment data. Moreover, the two-factor model produces origination prices that are significantly closer to those quoted in the to-be-announced market than the one-factor model. Our results have important implications for hedging mortgage-backed securities.},

abstract = {The quantitative aspirations of economists and financial analysts have for many years been based on the belief that it should be possible to build models of economic systems - and financial markets in particular - that are as predictive as those in physics. While this perspective has led to a number of important breakthroughs in economics, "physics envy" has also created a false sense of mathematical precision in some cases. We speculate on the origins of physics envy, and then describe an alternate perspective of economic behavior based on a new taxonomy of uncertainty. We illustrate the relevance of this taxonomy with two concrete examples: the classical harmonic oscillator with some new twists that make physics look more like economics, and a quantitative equity market-neutral strategy. We conclude by offering a new interpretation of tail events, proposing an "uncertainty checklist" with which our taxonomy can be implemented, and considering the role that quants played in the current financial crisis.},

Starting from a given model for market dynamics (price diffusion, rate diffusion, etc.), the algorithm corrects for price-misspecifications and finite-sample effects in the simulation by assigning "probability weights" to the simulated paths. The choice of weights is done by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy distance of the posterior measure to the empirical measure. The resulting ensemble prices the given set of benchmark instruments exactly or in the sense of least-squares. We discuss pricing and hedging in the context of these weighted Monte Carlo models. A significant reduction of variance is demonstrated theoretically as well as numerically. Concrete applications to the calibration of stochastic volatility models and term-structure models with up to forty benchmark instruments are presented.

A main application of inductive logic is the generalization of observational data to theoretical models. In the empirical sciences, the mathematical theory of statistics addresses the same problem. This paper argues that there is no separable purely logical aspect of statistical inference in a variety of complex problems. Instead, statistical practice is often motivated by decision-theoretic considerations and resembles empirical science. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The aim of the present paper is to trace the development of the literature and identify areas that require further research. This paper provides a literature review of the characteristics of financial data, commonly used models of portfolio selection, and portfolio risk measurement. In the summary of the characteristics of financial data, we summarize the literature on fat tail and dependence characteristic of financial data. In the portfolio selection model part, we cover three models: mean-variance model, global minimum variance (GMV) model and factor model. In the portfolio risk measurement part, we first classify risk measurement methods into two categories: moment-based risk measurement and moment-based and quantile-based risk measurement. Moment-based risk measurement includes time-varying covariance matrix and shrinkage estimation, while moment-based and quantile-based risk measurement includes semi-variance, VaR and CVaR.},

Employing a survey of recently published articles in four top-tier finance journals, we find that the conventional significance levels are exclusively used with little consideration of the key factors such as the sample size, power of the test, and expected losses. We also find that statistically significant results reported in many surveyed papers become questionable, if Bayesian method or revised standards for evidence were instead used. We observe strong evidence of publication bias in favour of statistical significance. We propose that substantial changes be made to the current practice of significance testing in finance research, in order to improve research credibility and integrity.},

It zeroes on the analysis of mathematical methods in financial economics and their connection to risk and uncertainty. Risk-neutral valuation, a direct consequence of Black-Scholes model, restricts the range of individual and subjective uncertainty by putting a price on replicable risk, thereby conferring to modern finance a unique kind of objectivity in pricing assets, as opposed to any speculative assessment. Yet, in another sense, this objectivity is only relative for it has no direct connection to the real world, nor any causal or predictive power, for modern finance ultimately deals with uncertainty itself. The paper sheds light on the articulation of these contrasting aspects.},

volatility,

jump-diffusions with stochastic volatility, and jump-diffusions with
stochas-

tic volatility and jump intensity. Next we apply the Fourier transform
for

solving the problem of European option pricing under these price processes.

We present two solution methods: the characteristic formula and the
Black-

Scholes-style formula. Finally, we discuss numerical implementation
of pricing

formulas and apply the considered processes for modeling the DAX options

abstract = {{T}his paper deals with region-of-interest ({ROI}) tracking in video
sequences. {T}he goal is to determine in successive frames the region
which best matches, in terms of a similarity measure, a {ROI} defined
in a reference frame. {S}ome tracking methods define similarity measures
which efficiently combine several visual features into a probability
density function ({PDF}) representation, thus building a discriminative
model of the {ROI}. {T}his approach implies dealing with {PDF}s with
domains of definition of high dimension. {T}o overcome this obstacle,
a standard solution is to assume independence between the different
features in order to bring out low-dimension marginal laws and/or
to make some parametric assumptions on the {PDF}s at the cost of
generality. {W}e discard these assumptions by proposing to compute
the {K}ullback-{L}eibler divergence between high-dimensional {PDF}s
using the k-th nearest neighbor framework. {I}n consequence, the
divergence is expressed directly from the samples, i.e. without explicit
estimation of the underlying {PDF}s. {A}s an application, we defined
5, 7, and 13-dimensional feature vectors containing color information
(including pixel-based, gradient-based and patch-based) and spatial
layout. {T}he proposed procedure performs tracking allowing for translation
and scaling of the {ROI}. {E}xperiments show its efficiency on a
movie excerpt and standard test sequences selected for the specific
conditions they exhibit: partial occlusions, variations of luminance,

In this modified model the conditional standard deviation is a piecewise linear function of past values of the white noise. This specific form allows different reactions of the volatility to different signs of the lagged errors. Stationarity conditions are derived. Maximum likelihood and least squares estimation are also considered. Finally an empirical example relating to the French CAC stock index is presented and several specifications are compared.},

@book{Mises2003,
abstract = {The historically most central epistemological issue concerning perception, to which this article will be almost entirely devoted, iswhether and how beliefs about physical objects and about the physicalworld generally can be justified or warranted on the basis of sensoryor perceptual experience—where it is internalist justification, roughly having a reason to think that the belief in question is true, that is mainly in question (see the entry internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).This issue, commonly referred to as “the problem of the external world,” divides into two closely related sub-issues, which correspond to the first two main sections below. The first of these issues has to do with the nature of sensory experience and its relation to the physical world; it is typically (though as we shall see not altogether perspicuously) formulated as the question of what are the immediate objects of awareness in sensory experienceor, in a variant but essentially equivalent terminology, of what is given in such experience. Perhaps the most historically standard, though not currently the most popular answer to this question has been that it is sense-data (private, non-physical entities that actually have the immediately experienced sensory qualities) that are the immediate objects of awareness or that are given. The second issue has to do with the way in which beliefs about the physical world are justified on the basis of such sensory experience. If it is concluded that physical objects are not themselves given, the two main answers to this question are representationalism or indirect realism (the view that the immediate objects of experience represent or depict physicalobjects in a way that allows one to infer justifiably from such experience to the existence of the corresponding “external” objects) and phenomenalism (the view that physical objects are reducible to or definable in terms of the occurrence and obtainability of such experience). A third alternativeview that has received much attention in recent discussion is direct realism: the view that physical objects are after all themselves directly or immediately perceived in a way that allegedly avoids the need for any sort of justificatory inference from sensory experience to physical reality. In addition to these views concerning the internalist justification of beliefs about physical objects, there are also externalist accounts of howsuch beliefs are justified; these will be briefly considered at the end of the article.},

Moreover, the argument of the criterion, called the auxiliary parameter, may have a larger dimension than that of the parameter of interest. A second step, based on simulations, provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameter of interest. Various testing procedures are also proposed. The methods described in this paper only require that the model can be simulated, therefore they should be useful for models whose complexity rules out a direct approach. Various fields of applications are suggested (microeconometrics, finance, macroeconometrics).},

We introduce here a quantitative framework for defining model uncertainty in option pricing models. After discussing some properties which a quantitative measure of model uncertainty should verify in order to be useful and relevant in the context of risk measurement and management, we propose a method for measuring model uncertainty which verifies these properties and yields numbers which are comparable to other risk measures and compatible with observations of market prices of a set of benchmark derivatives. We illustrate the difference between model uncertainty and the more common notion of "market risk" through examples. Finally, we illustrate the connection between our proposed measure of model uncertainty and the recent literature on coherent and convex risk measures.},

abstract = {Trading in derivatives involves heavy use of quantitative models for valuation and risk management. These models are necessarily imperfect, and when options are involved, the models require a volatility input that must be forecasted, subject to error. This creates “model risk” to which nearly all participants in derivatives markets are exposed. In this paper, we conduct an empirical simulation, with and without hedging, using historical data from 1976-1996 for several important markets. The object is to develop a quantitative assessment of the extent to which the different sources of model risk can be expected to affect the kind of basic option writing strategy that might be followed by a bank or another financial institution. Specifically, we explore the following problem: If a bank or a similar financial institution writes standard European calls and puts and prices them using the appropriate variant of the Black-Scholes model with a volatility forecast computed optimally from historical data, what are the risk and return characteristics of the trade? More generally, what is the market and model risk exposure faced by a bank that does this transaction repeatedly over time? The results indicate that pricing and hedging errors due to imperfect models and inaccurate volatility forecasts create sizable risk exposure for option writers. We then consider to what extent the bank can limit the damage due to model risk by pricing options using a higher volatility than its best estimate from historical data.},

In this paper the exact (1 - $\alpha$) confidence limits, R_{{\rm L}} and R_{{\rm U}}, have been simplified, and a new exact test of the null hypothesis that R = 1 has been derived. The exact methods depend on the F distribution; they are simple to calculate and all have been fully validated. Even after simplification, methods for obtaining approximations to R_{{\rm L}} and R_{{\rm U}} remain more unwieldy than the exact methods, and an evaluation shows that these approximations may occasionally be far from the truth. It is argued that there is no excuse for not using the exact methods.},

abstract = {In empirical modeling, there have been two strands

for pricing in the options literature, namely the parametric and

nonparametric models. Often, the support for the nonparametric

methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black–Scholes (BS)

model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic

volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models

as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network

(FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for

FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation

properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since

the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing

tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing func-

tion is essential for pricing and hedging. Our ﬁndings indicate that

FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over

their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings.

There are two routes to explain the superiority of FNN models over

the parametric models in forecast settings. These are nonnormality

of return distributions and adaptive learning.},

abstract = {This paper is on the portfolio optimization problem for which two generic models are presented in the context of a proprietary solver called GENO:1 the first is a pseudo-dynamic model with a single state variable that is meant for the single holding-period case; the second is a truly dynamic model with several state variables that applies to both single and multi-period scenarios. Both models can handle practical restrictions such as exposure, cardinality and round-lot constraints; both can accommodate non-traditional risk measures; and the usual two-element criterion set comprising ‘portfolio reward' and ‘portfolio risk' may be augmented by any number of sub- objectives deemed necessary. The paper also presents a ‘robust optimization' model of the portfolio problem that explicitly accounts for data uncertainty; the robust model can also accommodate sophisticated risk measures, and one such function is presented in Appendix B. The compromise solution concept is used to compute portfolios that are Pareto-efficient; several numerical examples show that the portfolios thus found are not only optimal in the compromise sense, but they also have a competitive (and often the highest) reward-risk ratio—a proxy for the Sharpe ratio. A limited empirical analysis shows that the robust model is superior to its non-robust counterpart in terms of both nominal performance, and the potential for avoiding “opportunity costs” due data uncertainty.},

abstract = {Substantial progress has been made in developing more realistic option
pricing models. Empirically, however, it is not known whether and
by how much each generalization improves option pricing and hedging.
We fill this gap by first deriving an option model that allows volatility,
interest rates and jumps to be stochastic. Using S&P 500 options,
we examine several alternative models from three perspectives: (1)
internal consistency of implied parameters/volatility with relevant
time-series data, (2) out-of-sample pricing, and (3) hedging. Overall,
incorporating stochastic volatility and jumps is important for pricing
and internal consistency. But for hedging, modeling stochastic volatility
alone yields the best performance.},

abstract = {We exploit ideas from high-dimensional data analysis to derive new portmanteau tests that are based on the trace of the square of the mth order autocorrelation matrix. The resulting statistics are weighted sums of the squares of the sample autocorrelation coefficients that, unlike many other tests appearing in the literature, are numerically stable even when the number of lags considered is relatively close to the sample size. The statistics behave asymptotically as a linear combination of chi-squared random variables and their asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a gamma distribution. The proposed tests are modified to check for nonlinearity and to check the adequacy of a fitted nonlinear model. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed goodness of fit tests tend to have higher power than other tests appearing in the literature, particularly in detecting long-memory nonlinear models. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated by investigating nonlinear effects in Apple, Inc., and Nikkei-300 daily returns during the 2006–2007 calendar years.

centers on the accurate assessment of individual market and credit
risks with relatively little theoretical or applied econometric research

optimal risk control. We argue that consideration of the model risk
arising from crude aggregation rules and inadequate data could lead
to a new class of reduced-form Bayesian risk assessment models. Logically,
these models should be set within a common factor framework that
allows proper risk aggregation methods to be developed. We explain
how such a framework could also provide the essential links between
risk control, risk assessments, and the optimal allocation of resources.

abstract = {In empirical modeling, there have been two strands for pricing in the options literature, namely the parametric and nonparametric models. Often, the support for the nonparametric methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black-Scholes (BS) model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging. Our findings indicate that FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings. There are two routes to explain the superiority of FNN models over the parametric models in forecast settings. These are nonnormality of return distributions and adaptive learning.},

abstract = {In this article we demonstrate that the optimal portfolios generated by the Black-Litterman asset allocation model have a very simple, intuitive property. The unconstrained optimal portfolio in the Black-Litterman model is the scaled market equilibrium portfolio (reflecting the uncertainty in the equilibrium expected returns) plus a weighted sum of portfolios representing the investor's views. The weight on a portfolio representing a view is positive when the view is more bullish than the one implied by the equilibrium and the other views. The weight increases as the investor becomes more bullish on the view, and the magnitude of the weight also increases as the investor becomes more confident about the view.},

@article{Artzner1999,
abstract = {In this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. We present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." We examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by SPAN, by the SEC/NASD rules, and by quantile-based methods. We demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. We offer suggestions concerning the SEC method. We also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods.},
